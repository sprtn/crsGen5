Curse Generator!

Are you lazy like me, but still enjoy a good banter?
Despair not! Programming has made your life simple. At the click of a button, you can get your very own despicable curse!
Are you feeling lucky? Are you so one with the machine, that you dare use the random curse button, and send it to your targets without knowing what you send? Or do you want to customize your squarry, and wait for something truly jaw-dropping and mind-shattering?

If you find a curse you like parts of, but not all parts, you can edit the text field yourself, and still use the copy to clipboard function!


Wanting for updates:
I would love to make the crsGen more appealing, and add macro key support, so that it can work in full-screen applications. If I take up this project again, that will be the #1 concern.

Disclaimer: The crsGen was not created to be politically correct. I am not responsible for what strings it places together, you are. Use your newfound power wisely.
